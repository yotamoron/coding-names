One of the most important things a developer needs to pay attention to when engaged in coding, is to constantly reduce the cognitive load one's creating.
Before we discuss on how to reduce cognitive load, first let me define what is cognitive load when it comes to coding.

Software development envolves learning - a lot. One has to:
* read through code, documentation and comments 
* create many long lasting mental models in many domains (and constantly adjust and evolve those models, and sometimes event scrap them altogether), 
* understand in varying degrees any mathematical or other scientific subjects, tools, paradigms, concepts, theories etc 


* Context switch
* The need to remember state
* The need to understand structure, meaning, instructions
