There are a few reasons why good names matter - alot.
1. A good name needs to convey the meaning and intent of the named entity (application, module, class, variable etc).
   So, for a name to be good - one must understand very well why the named entity is needed, what is its role,
   what the developer should (and shouldn't know about it) etc. This means, that the developer has to understand
   what they are doing, have a good grasp of the system and its architecture.
2. One of the most important efforts when writing code, is reducing the cognitive load on the developer as much as possible.
   Fact is, the human short-term memory is very small (between 5-9 items). Another fact is, developers spend **alot** of time 
   reading code and making sense of it. When the names of the named entities are bad, the cognitive load on the 
   developer increases dramatically - instead of just reading the name, the developer now have to develop a long term memory of what 
   the entity really stands for (as its name is bad). Moving items from the short-term human memory to the long term one is just hard.
   Good descriptive, concise, accurate names makes it much easier for developers to figure out what the piece of code they have 
   in front of them. Instead of wasting time on creating new long-term memory item of what things really mean, all they have to do is **read** 
   the name. Stressless, fluent, pleasent.
