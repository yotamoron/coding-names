**A bunch of words and other stuff that will help naming stuff while programming. 
The aim of this file is to include words that actually appear in code and carry 
a very distinct and well-defined meaning, so that the next time you think to 
yourself 'damn, what is the word I should use in this function name / file name / variable name??' - you'll have a place to look...**
